                  Hello, I'm Naren Nandakumar and I have been programming for more than 5 years now! 
                  Having learnt AP CSA in 9th grade and teaching it since, I have almost 3 years of 
                  experience teaching and know exactly what students need the most to succeed in their class. 
                  Some of my accomplishments include programming an optimal maze solver, a graphing calculator 
                  application, an optimal tic-tac-toe agent, 3D voxel video game, and a health app with the 
                  sole goal of reducing the barrier to affordable healthcare. I love computer science and 
                  the opportunity to brighten those on its path!

                  Hello, I'm Manu Pradeep, a senior at Lone Star High School in Texas. I have been passionate about programming for several years and have honed my skills through dedicated practice and project development. As the co-founder of JavaQuest, I have spent the past three years teaching Java to students, helping them not only understand the fundamentals of coding but also excel in their coursework, particularly in AP Computer Science A, a course that I excelled in. My notable projects include an online guitar simulator, a sound visualizer, a sandbox game, a 2D platformer game, and a visualizer for Conway's Game of Life. I've also received a Java certification from Certiport as well. I love computer science and the opportunity to brighten those on its path!

            <p className="text-foreground/80 text-lg mb-4">
              Founded in 2023, JavaQuest began when we saw a major problem in the world: Many people lack the resources and necessities we often take for granted. We wanted to find a way to raise money for these individuals, which is why we decided to teach Java and donate the money we made to non-profits whose sole purpose is bettering the lives of those in need. What started as a small community project has now evolved into a full organization, teaching many students and helping lives in America and beyond.
