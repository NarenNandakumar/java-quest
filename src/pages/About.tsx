                  Hello, I'm Naren Nandakumar and I have been programming for more than 5 years now! 
                  Having learnt AP CSA in 9th grade and teaching it since, I have almost 3 years of 
                  experience teaching and know exactly what students need the most to succeed in their class. 
                  Some of my accomplishments include programming an optimal maze solver, a graphing calculator 
                  application, an optimal tic-tac-toe agent, 3D voxel video game, and a health app with the 
                  sole goal of reducing the barrier to affordable healthcare. I love computer science and 
                  the opportunity to brighten those on its path!

                  Hello, I'm Manu Pradeep, a Junior going to Lone Star High School in Texas. I love to code, 
                  and help other people. I co-founded JavaQuest in order to help other students to not only 
                  grasp how coding works, but also help them excel in their future classes. I have taught 
                  students coding in Java for the past 2 years. I have prior experience in the AP Computer 
                  Science A, as I took the class and excelled on the test. I've made an online guitar 
                  simulator, a sound visualizer, a sandbox game, 2D platformer game, and a visualizer of 
                  the game of life. I hope that everyone I teach will excel in the world of computer science.

            <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-4">
              Founded in 2023, JavaQuest began when we saw a major problem in the world: Many people lack the resources and necessities we often take for granted. We wanted to find a way to raise money for these individuals, which is why we decided to teach Java and donate the money we made to non-profits whose sole purpose is bettering the lives of those in need. What started as a small community project has now evolved into a full organization, teaching many students and helping lives in America and beyond.
